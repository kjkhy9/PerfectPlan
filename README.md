to setup the backend locally run:

cd backend
npm install
npm start

To confirm server is running you should see a prompt like "Server running on port 5000" in the terminal

to setup the front end do the same thing but instead of "cd backend" run:
cd frontend
cd perfectplan

you may have to run npm install
